/*
 The first thing to notice is that constructors look an awful lot like methods. 
 A key difference is that a constructor can't ever, ever, ever, have a return type…ever! 
 Constructor declarations can however have all of the normal access modifiers, 
 and they can take arguments (including var-args), just like methods. 
 The other BIG RULE, to understand about constructors is that they must have the same name as the class 
 in which they are declared. 
 
 Constructors can't be marked static (they are after all associated with object instantiation), 
 they can't be marked final or abstract (because they can't be overridden).
